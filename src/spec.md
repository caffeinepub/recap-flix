# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a Netflix-style web application that allows users to browse and read movie recap scripts with a familiar streaming interface.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a Netflix-inspired homepage with hero section, horizontal scrollable movie rows organized by categories, and top navigation bar
- Implement movie detail pages that display full recap scripts with metadata
- Add search functionality to filter movies by title with grid result layout
- Create "My List" feature for saving movie recaps with persistent storage
- Design responsive layout adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- Apply dark theme visual design with Netflix-style aesthetics (deep blacks, red accents, modern typography)
- Build backend data model to store movie information, metadata, and recap scripts
- Seed database with at least 20 sample movies across multiple genres with complete recap scripts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse movie recaps in a Netflix-style interface, search for specific titles, read full recap scripts on detail pages, and save favorites to their personal list for later reading.
