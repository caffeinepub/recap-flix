  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements for fixing the blank screen issue through error boundaries, loading states, skeleton UI, error handling, and console logging. However, REQ-15 backend verification is only partially addressed, and REQ-17 authentication flow handling is not evident in the diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Verify the backend main.mo actor properly initializes with stable storage and returns valid responses for getAllMovies and searchMovies queries",
      "reason": "The backend changes show a preupgrade function that seeds sample movies, but there is no evidence of stable storage initialization verification or explicit handling to ensure getAllMovies returns empty array (not null) on first deployment before seeding. The preupgrade function seeds data but doesn't demonstrate proper stable storage initialization flow.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Ensure the Internet Identity authentication flow properly initializes and does not block rendering of public movie content on the homepage",
      "reason": "No changes to authentication initialization logic are shown in the diff. The constraint explicitly states not to modify useInternetIdentity.ts, but there's no evidence of changes elsewhere to ensure authentication doesn't block rendering or handles initialization errors gracefully.",

      "description": "Migration module for converting Set-based userLists to List-based userLists",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest makes no mention of data migration needs or changing the userLists data structure from Set to List. This migration functionality was not requested and appears to be implementing a schema change that wasn't part of the blank screen fix requirements.",
