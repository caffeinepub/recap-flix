  "summary": "The implementation covers most core requirements including frontend components, backend data model, routing, and Netflix-inspired styling. However, several requirements are partially implemented or missing: the backend lacks query methods by category, sample data seeding is incomplete (only 2 movies instead of 20+), responsive design lacks mobile hamburger menu collapse, and navigation scroll behavior is not fully implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Horizontal scrollable rows organized by categories (e.g., 'Trending Recaps', 'Action Movies', 'Drama', 'Comedy')",
      "reason": "HomePage.tsx seeds sample movies but does not organize them into category-based rows. All movies are fetched via searchMovies('') but not filtered/grouped by genre for display in separate rows.",

        "frontend/src/pages/HomePage.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Query methods to retrieve movies by category",
      "reason": "Backend main.mo lacks a method to retrieve movies filtered by genre/category. Only searchMovies (by title text) and getMovie (by single title) exist.",

        "backend/main.mo"

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Navigation collapses to hamburger menu on mobile",
      "reason": "Navbar.tsx has a Sheet component for mobile menu, but navigation links are only hidden on desktop (hidden md:flex). The hamburger menu does not actually collapse/replace the center navigation links on mobile as specified.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/Navbar.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-10",
      "requirement": "Seed the backend with sample movie data for at least 20 movies across multiple genres",
      "reason": "Backend seedData() in main.mo only includes 2 sample movies (Inception and The Godfather). HomePage.tsx attempts to seed more movies but only adds 3 additional movies, totaling far less than the required 20 movies across 4-5 genres.",
